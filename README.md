# Segmented control button for Android

Implementation of a segmented control button for Android. A Segmented
Control is really a better looking and more touch friendly version of
a RadioButton.  In fact, this implementation inherits from Android's
default RadioButton.

The controls are customizable and themed in the fashion of the stock
controls in Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and above.

The project contains a sample activity that shows how the buttons are
implemented and styled.
